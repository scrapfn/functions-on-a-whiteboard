      <h2>Introduction to Functions</h2>
<h3>Relations</h3>

<blockquote>
<p>A relation is any set of ordered pairs.
The set of all first components of the ordered pairs is called the domain of the relation
and the set of all second component is called the range of the relation.</p>

<p>-- from Intermidiate Algebra by Robert Blitzer</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="text language-text" data-lang="text">{}                 is a relation      --- A
{(1,2)}             is a relation      --- B
{(1,1),(1,2),(2,1)}      is a relation      --- C
(1,2)               is not a relation

domain of A is {}
domain of B is {1}
domain of C is {1,2}

range of A is {}
range of B is {2}
range of C is {1,2}
</code></pre></div>
<h4>Programming Terminology</h4>

<ul>
<li>Sets are present in many programming languages by default.</li>
<li>Ordered pairs are often called tuples.</li>
<li>Domains and ranges can be described by types. We will come back to it some days later.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Functions</h3>

<blockquote>
<p>A function is a correspondance from first set, called the domain,
to a second set, called the range, such that each element in the domain corresponds to
<strong>exactly one element</strong> in the range.</p>

<p>-- from Intermidiate Algebra by Robert Blitzer</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="text language-text" data-lang="text">{}                is a function
{(1,2)}            is a function
{(1,1),(1,2),(2,1)}     is not a function
{(0,0),(1,3),(2,3)}  is a function
</code></pre></div>
<h4>Caution to Programmers</h4>

<p>The definition of a function clearly states that a function is a relation which has a domain and a range. &quot;functions&quot; that perform some side-effects and returns undefined value have no range which makes them non-functions.</p>

<p>The definition also states that &quot;each element in the domain corresponds to exactly one element in the range&quot;. This ensures that you get the same result every time whenever a function is applied on a value. Therefore <code>random()</code>, <code>date()</code>, and <code>obj . getName()</code> are not functions.</p>

<h3>Functions as Equations and Function Notation</h3>

<p>Functions are usually given in terms of equation.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="text language-text" data-lang="text">f(x) = x + 1
</code></pre></div>
<p>The above code denotes that the function <code>f</code>, when applied to a value, evaluates to the value itself plus 1. The application of a function to a value is expressed as <code>function(value)</code>. Therefore <code>f(2)</code> eveluates to 3 and <code>f(-4)</code> evaluates to -3 and so on.</p>

<p>Functions can have more than one variable. For example, <code>+</code> can be seen as a function that is applied to two numbers to yield another value.</p>

<h3>Graphing a Function</h3>

<p>Functions with one variable will result in a line graph.

<p>Functions with more than one variable will result in a complicated multi dimention graph.
